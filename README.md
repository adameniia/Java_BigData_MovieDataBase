# Java_BigData_MovieDataBase
Work with some collections and big data about the movies filmed in San Francisco
In this program I demonstrate an ability to work with "Big Data" and some Collection Classes.
Also the big and important part of the program is reading files and writing to them, and Exception handling with the try-catch-finally block
Using such classes as Scanner, BufferWriter, FileWriter, BufferReader, FileReader, IOException, custom (written by me) Exception class, custom Movie class
Collections and Interfaces: List, ArrayList, Iterator
