# Java_BigData_MovieDataBase
Work with some collections and big data about the movies filmed in San Francisco

In this program I demonstrate an ability to work with "Big Data" and some Collection Classes.

Also the big and important part of the program is reading files and writing to them, and Exception handling with the try-catch-finally block.

Using such classes as Scanner, BufferWriter, FileWriter, BufferReader, FileReader, IOException, custom (written by me) Exception class, custom Movie class.

Collections and Interfaces: List, ArrayList, Iterator

DataDriver.java - the driver program that uses all of the created classes and the data, and shows the output \n

Movie.java - the class that represents a movie from the data

MovieCreationException.java - a written exception
